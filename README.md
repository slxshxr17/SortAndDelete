# SortAndDelete
Sorting files in folder from 0 to last file and deleting files that are the same.

After pasting a folder, where you have all your files it sorts them and then delete duplicated files. So let's say you have 70 files in folder, named randomly, like IMG_1010101010.
It renames all file from "0.jpg" to "79.jpg"
If any of two files are same program deletes one of them.
